They know that I know... Soul is about emotions, and how they can help deal with problems... All people deal with them differently... All that I saw - I lived through. All of my emotions are so different, and so important. If you'll kill them, you will suffer much more, then with them. You will catch the brink of insanity... Some people deal with proplems without emotions. It leads to killing themself, or to going insane, or in "empty vessel" state. To fix it you need to understand your emotions. Understand your body. Understand your soul and existance. Cause of my simple ignorance of my emotions, I am here, crying while they dying. For me. I feel myself living, but without me present. I feel all, but nothing. Day by day here, I just keep destroying myself, making bad choises... Only one small thing keeping me sane for now. My talisman...</br>While We still stay strong, hope, we will see again, my dear...
